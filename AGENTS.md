# AGENTS.md — Neverlands-Based Rails MMORPG Engineering Contract

Contract metadata:

- updated_at: `2026-09-25`
- why_changed: "Remove the Neverlands authority section. The Creator's formulas and МистВар mechanics are now the main authority."

This file is the repository entry point for engineering work. It tells an agent
what to read, which rules are mandatory, what to verify, and what to report.
`doc/RUBY_ON_RAILS_GUIDE.md` supplies deeper Ruby, Rails, and Hotwire guidance;
it does not duplicate this workflow or define game design.

Sections marked `[NORMATIVE]` are mandatory. Examples are proportional: apply a
boundary only when the changed behavior needs it.

The Creator's formulas and МистВар mechanics are now the main authority.

## 2. [NORMATIVE] Standard engineering workflow

Every implementation, bug fix, behavior change, refactor, migration, or
executable process-tooling change automatically follows this workflow. No
special prompt phrase, YAML receipt, profile declaration, or per-conversation
changelog is required.

Read-only explanation, review, diagnosis, and planning do not authorize edits.

1. **Orient** — read the relevant truth layers, routes, owners, UI, config,
   schema, and existing specs.
2. **Resolve scope** — state the intended behavior and important evidence,
   security, persistence, concurrency, Hotwire, or operational risks.
3. **Inspect ownership** — extend the smallest existing Rails/domain owner;
   preserve unrelated user changes and avoid parallel pipelines.
4. **Implement** — use the smallest clear Rails-native solution that preserves
   server authority and Neverlands behavior.
5. **Test while working** — add applicable focused coverage and run the
   smallest useful specs/lint after coherent slices.
6. **Review the stable diff** — apply the risk-based questions in
   `doc/RUBY_ON_RAILS_GUIDE.md`; correct concrete findings before completion.
7. **Synchronize documentation** — update each canonical document whose owned
   truth changed. Do not edit unrelated documents merely to create ceremony.
8. **Verify** — run the proportional completion command from section 8.
9. **Manual browser acceptance** — after automated checks pass, personally
   exercise the changed local UI and flow in a real browser as required by
   [section 8](#manual-browser-acceptance).
10. **Report** — summarize rationale, behavior/files, documentation, exact check
   outcomes, and any remaining `[EVIDENCE]` or deferred risk.

### Optional planning-first gate

Use a stop-gate only when the user asks for a plan before implementation or
asks to work per `AGENTS.md` without yet authorizing changes:

1. extract evidence and the player/server contract;
2. scan current implementation and tests;
3. propose `NEW`, `MODIFY`, and `DELETE` actions, coverage, and up to five
   risks;
4. end with `CONFIRM_TO_IMPLEMENT? (yes/no)` and wait.

After approval, continue at step 4 of the standard workflow without repeating
the plan or asking for a second confirmation.

## 3. [NORMATIVE] Scope, safety, and repository care

Normal implementation scope may include `app/**`, applicable `config/**`,
`db/**`, `lib/**`, `spec/**`, relevant design/feature documents, and
`.env.example`.

Editing `AGENTS.md`, canonical templates, repository-wide documentation
structure, CI, production/deployment configuration, or secrets requires
explicit task scope. The current task must not expand into those areas by
implication.

- Preserve unrelated dirty-worktree changes.
- Never expose, copy, log, or commit credentials, cookies, or tokens.
- Never mutate production data while testing.
- Resolve exact targets before destructive filesystem or database actions.
- Do not edit committed migrations unless the user explicitly authorizes a
  pre-release schema-history rewrite.
- Verification commands must not rewrite source files; never use lint auto-fix
  as a completion check. Browser acceptance may perform bounded, authorized
  gameplay mutations on local development test data; preserve unrelated data.

## 4. [NORMATIVE] Implementation approach

Every approach must satisfy these criteria proportionally:

- **Rails way** — prefer framework conventions and existing repository
  capabilities over custom frameworks or dependencies.
- **SRP/cohesion** — an object owns one cohesive reason to change; this does not
  mean one class per method.
- **Practical DI** — make meaningful collaborators, clocks, RNGs, catalogs, and
  side effects explicit where substitution improves clarity or determinism;
  do not add a DI container by default.
- **PORO/KISS** — choose the smallest clear object boundary and remove wrappers
  whose only rationale is style or hypothetical reuse.
- **Justified services** — introduce a service/query only for multi-record
  orchestration, a state transition/transaction, external IO/side effects, or
  a material clarity/testability improvement.
- **Hotwire fit** — keep HTML/server state primary, Turbo fragment ownership
  stable, and Stimulus narrowly focused on client enhancement.

Prefer conventional Rails ownership:

- controllers orchestrate requests, strong parameters, authorization, and
  response selection;
- models own associations, validations, scopes, enums, and small domain rules;
- database constraints protect durable invariants;
- policies own record/action authorization;
- services own justified workflows and transactions, not simple model proxies;
- query objects own materially complex/reused bounded reads;
- ERB renders state; helpers/presenters format it without hidden database work;
- Stimulus manages focused browser behavior, never authoritative game rules.

Document a new or materially changed service/query object's purpose and public
entry-point inputs, output, and important side effects. Explain non-obvious
private rules, not Ruby syntax.

## 5. [NORMATIVE] Gameplay correctness

The client expresses intent and displays results. The server alone decides and
persists coordinates, locations, availability, cooldowns, combat outcomes,
inventory, equipment, currency, ownership, rewards, and other gameplay state.

Treat submitted ids, prices, quantities, coordinates, timers, labels, CSS
geometry, hidden values, and capability flags as untrusted. At mutation time,
revalidate authentication, authorization, ownership, current state, target,
availability, expiry, balance/capacity, and boundary conditions.

Every persistent gameplay transition must make these facts identifiable in
implementation and tests:

1. authoritative records, inputs, and preconditions;
2. successful state changes and side effects;
3. failure behavior and state that remains unchanged;
4. transaction/locking/constraint boundary where correctness needs one;
5. retry, duplicate, or concurrent behavior where realistic;
6. resulting authoritative state rendered or returned.

Use the simplest sufficient transaction, lock, unique key, database constraint,
or scoped idempotency guard. A failed valuable transition must not leave
partial state, and a retry/double click must not duplicate rewards, items,
money, movement, collection, or combat state. Do not add a universal command
bus, event store, or idempotency framework.

Additional invariants:

- authored cells, NPCs, shops, resources, encounters, rewards, and balance
  values use stable ids and Neverlands-backed config/seeds/records;
- content validation happens at its loading or persistence boundary;
- pure calculations do not query the database;
- random behavior accepts/constructs a seeded RNG at a testable boundary;
- the server clock owns expiry/cooldowns, and tests cover before/at/after where
  timing matters;
- valuable currency/inventory/reward/PvP/admin changes leave a bounded,
  secret-safe audit record or structured log when reconstruction matters.

## 6. [NORMATIVE] Hotwire, async, performance, and operations

### Hotwire and client behavior

- Prefer Turbo Drive, Frames, and Streams for server-rendered interaction.
- Use Stimulus targets, values, and actions instead of global state or broad DOM
  queries; clean up timers/listeners on disconnect.
- Keep frame ids and stream targets stable and single-owned.
- Publish realtime presentation only after committed authoritative state.
- Make reconnect/reload recover from persisted state; broadcast order is not
  gameplay authority.
- Escape dynamic output and add applicable keyboard/accessibility coverage.

### Deferred work and broadcasts

For important jobs or external/realtime side effects, define retryability,
idempotency, missing/stale records, after-commit timing, and a bounded recovery
path. Queue telemetry is not automatically durable application intent. Add a
ledger/reconciler only when losing work cannot be recovered safely from current
authoritative state.

### Reads, caches, and operational tools

- Prevent N+1 and query-per-row behavior; preload and bound collections/batches
  that can grow.
- A cache/projection is derived state. Define complete keys/version, freshness,
  invalidation, malformed/unavailable fallback, publication safety, and
  targeted recovery only when such a component exists.
- Separate structural query/row/batch budgets from measured latency claims.
  Benchmarks state environment, workload, sample size, percentiles, and errors.
- Risky operator mutations are exact-target, fail closed, observable, and
  post-verified; status output is bounded and secret-safe.

These are review questions, not instructions to add caches, jobs, ledgers,
metrics, runbooks, or abstractions to a feature that does not need them.

## 7. [NORMATIVE] Tests and coverage

Every executable feature, bug fix, behavior change, or refactor requires tests.
Process tooling requires focused tests where practical. Documentation-only
copy changes do not require invented runtime specs.

Choose layers by changed behavior, not by a universal checklist:

- model specs for model rules and persistence invariants;
- service/query specs for public workflow/query boundaries;
- request/policy specs for HTTP, ownership, and authorization;
- view/helper specs for rendering contracts;
- system specs for meaningful Turbo/Stimulus/browser interaction;
- job/config/cache/task specs for their actual lifecycle and failure modes;
- seed/config/schema specs when malformed content or migration boundaries can
  break gameplay.

Cover the applicable categories:

- **success** — intended persisted and rendered result;
- **failure** — safe rejection and unchanged authoritative state;
- **edge/null/boundary** — empty/nil/zero/max/out-of-range/time/capacity cases;
- **authorization** — anonymous, foreign owner, role/context denial;
- **retry/concurrency** — for vulnerable valuable mutations.

An inapplicable category needs no fake spec or metadata declaration. Do not
require model, policy, request, or system coverage when that layer was not
touched and another public boundary proves the behavior more directly.

Keep one thin system-spec path for the MVP core loop:

```text
login -> restore location -> travel -> enter/leave -> logout -> login -> restore
```

Test detailed variants at narrower layers. Blueprint and rswag specs apply only
if those surfaces actually exist.

## 8. [NORMATIVE] Documentation and verification

### Documentation synchronization

Documentation must reflect changed truth in the same task:

- evidence changes update the relevant observation/source summary;
- normalized game behavior changes update design/MVP scope;
- shipped runtime behavior or ownership changes update its feature handbook;
- process/tool behavior changes update its canonical process/onboarding docs;
- cross-feature operational procedures use `doc/guides/**` only when one real
  workflow spans several owners.

Do not update every document that mentions a topic. Update the canonical owner
and any directly contradicted summaries/links. Historical changelogs remain
historical.

New shipped handbooks use the eight-section `feature-v3` template in
`doc/features/FEATURE_TEMPLATE.md`. Existing `feature-v1`/`feature-v2`
handbooks may remain until a material rewrite is useful. Acceptance-to-spec
tables are optional and reserved for high-risk or cross-cutting gameplay where
they materially improve traceability.

`NOT_IMPLEMENTED` documents must not invent runtime files, routes, specs, or
state. Use the lean gap template.

Changelogs/change notes are optional. Create one when the user requests it, a
release/rollout needs it, or a durable architectural decision is otherwise hard
to discover. They are not workflow state and do not gate verification.

### Verification commands

During implementation, run focused checks such as:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/changed_spec.rb
bin/rubocop path/to/changed.rb spec/path/to/changed_spec.rb
bin/feature-doc-audit doc/features/<feature>.md
```

Completion profiles:

- `bin/verify fast` — default for ordinary runtime changes: read-only lint,
  non-system specs, and documentation audits;
- `bin/verify combat` — focused arena/formula work plus lint/docs;
- `bin/verify full` — broad/high-risk runtime changes, dependencies, migrations
  with material data risk, release readiness, or explicit user request;
- `bin/verify docs` — documentation architecture/templates only;
- process/verification changes — run focused script/audit specs, read-only lint,
  and `bin/verify docs`; add `fast`/`full` when their behavior or risk warrants
  the broader suite.

CI independently runs security, lint, non-system specs, system specs, and
documentation audits. Local verification never requires editing a receipt or
changelog into a special state.

The documentation audits intentionally enforce a small set of objective facts:
resolving canonical links/paths, required ownership/navigation, unresolved
template placeholders, duplicate handbook ownership, and false
`NOT_IMPLEMENTED` runtime claims. They do not enforce README prose, a fixed
document inventory, or universal acceptance matrices.

### Manual browser acceptance

For any change affecting a browser-visible surface or player flow, the agent
must personally verify the final local implementation through browser tools
**after the required automated checks pass and before reporting completion**.
This includes artwork, CSS, Hotwire interactions, and server changes behind a
UI flow. Earlier exploratory checks are useful but do not replace this final
acceptance pass. Automated system specs, HTTP requests, DOM inspection, or
screenshots alone do not establish that the flow works through the UI.

- Use the running local app with the final code/assets and an authorized local
  session or development test player. Exercise actual links, buttons, forms,
  tabs, and hotspots involved in the change; do not bypass the UI action with
  direct requests or database writes and call that manual acceptance.
- Follow the affected flow from entry through its action, visible result, and
  return/navigation. For persisted state, revisit or reload to confirm it
  survives. Include relevant empty/error states and recovery. A Shop flow may
  require buy → Inventory → find item → equip → confirm on player → unequip →
  confirm in Inventory; merely opening Shop is insufficient for that scope.
- Inspect the rendered result as well as behavior: artwork/composition,
  clipping, labels, feedback, overlays, and reachable controls. For changed
  layout or controls, apply the relevant viewport, keyboard/pointer, zoom, and
  hotspot checks from
  [adaptive UI acceptance](doc/design/areas/game_client_layout.md#adaptive-ui-acceptance).
  Restore temporary browser settings after checking.
- If a check fails, fix the issue, rerun the affected automated checks and the
  required completion profile, then repeat the affected final browser flow on
  the corrected version. Evidence-only documentation updates afterward require
  the relevant documentation audit, not another unchanged browser run.
- Record the actual browser, viewport/input mode, steps, observed results, and
  remaining gaps in the responsible handbook or task handoff; attach useful
  screenshots for visual changes without secrets. Distinguish manual evidence
  from automated tests, CI, and Neverlands observations.
- If the local app, browser, or required test state is unavailable, report the
  blocker and unverified flow explicitly; do not mark that UI scope Done.
  Documentation-only changes and backend work with no browser-visible effect
  may report manual browser acceptance as not applicable, with a brief reason.

## 9. [NORMATIVE] Final review and handoff

Before reporting completion:

- inspect the final diff and `git status`;
- confirm no generic RPG behavior or prohibited Neverlands identity/assets
  entered runtime;
- review applicable server authority, SRP/DI/PORO/KISS/service, Hotwire,
  atomicity/retry, query, async/cache, and operational risks;
- ensure canonical documentation describes verified behavior;
- confirm final [manual browser acceptance](#manual-browser-acceptance) passed
  for the changed UI scope, or explicitly report why it is blocked/not applicable;
- report exact checks and honest pending/pre-existing failures.

Use these headings:

```markdown
### RATIONALE

### CHANGES

### CHECKS
```

Keep the handoff concise, include clickable file paths where useful, and call
out remaining `[EVIDENCE]`, `[IMPL]`, or `[DOC]` gaps explicitly.
