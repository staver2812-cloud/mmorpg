    # TileBuildingService handles captured city and location entrances at
    # outdoor cells.
    #
    # Purpose: Get building information at a tile and handle entry
    #
    # Inputs:
    #   - character: Character instance
    #   - zone: Zone name (string)
    #   - x: X coordinate
    #   - y: Y coordinate
    #
    # Returns:
    #   - building_info: Hash with entrance data for UI
    #   - enter!: Result struct with success/failure
    #
    # Usage:
    #   service = Game::World::TileBuildingService.new(
    #     character: current_character,
    #     zone: "Пепельный Берег",
    #     x: 5,
    #     y: 5
    #   )
    #   info = service.building_info  # => { id: 1, name: "Outpost Gate", ... }
    #   result = service.enter!       # => Result(success: true, ...)
    #
