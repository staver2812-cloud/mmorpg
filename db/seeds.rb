# frozen_string_literal: true

# Explicit dependency order for a repeatable Rails bootstrap. Each phase owns
# its records and resolves its inputs from the database; no shared local scope
# or request-time content materialization is involved. `load` intentionally
# reruns phases when Rails.application.load_seed is called again.
# Outdoor NPC bootstrap follows entrances so it can respect their authored cells.
