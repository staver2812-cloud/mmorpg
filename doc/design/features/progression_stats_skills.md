# Progression, Stats, And Skills

Domain navigation: `doc/domains/character.md`.

## Purpose

Progression turns repeated play into long-term character growth. Stats define
base capability. Skills express trained expertise and should visibly affect
movement, combat, and source-backed social/economy access.

## Neverlands Reference

Reference material:

- `doc/design/reference/neverlands.md`
- `doc/design/reference/character/observations/legacy_skills_and_arena_analysis.md`
- `doc/design/reference/social/observations/2026-08-23_chat_game_event_timeline.md`
- `doc/design/reference/source_material.md`

Important borrowed ideas:

- stat allocation is explicit;
- `Умения` are explicit 0-100 numeric skills;
- `Навыки` are explicit yes/no perks and remain separate from numeric skills;
- skill points are split between combat/magic/resistance and peace/world pools;
- numeric skills use tiered 25-point bands where one spend can add a different
  amount depending on current level;
- skills and perks have categories;
- skills can unlock or improve combat and non-combat mechanics only after the
  exact Neverlands formulas or gates are captured;
- perks can have mutual exclusions;
- the UI should show available points, current values, and missing
  requirements.

## Observed Starter Allocation Flow

The 2026-05-14 live starter-account pass confirms the launch shape of the
player progression surface:

- the player page is reached from the gameplay shell through `Ваш персонаж`;
- the profile page keeps the character strip, equipment doll, money, stats,
  experience, fight record, fatigue, attack cost, and subnavigation together;
- primary stats are allocated directly on the profile summary;
- `Умения` is a separate profile subpage for 0-100 numeric skills;
- `Навыки` is a separate profile subpage for yes/no perks;
- every allocation page supports local plus/minus preview and one explicit
  `Сохранить` save;
- after save, the selected values become the new base values and no longer
  count as reversible pending edits.

Starter profile baseline from that pass:

| Label | Starter Value | Allocation Control |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Сила` | 1 | plus/minus |
| `Ловкость` | 1 | plus/minus |
| `Удача` | 1 | plus/minus |
| `Здоровье` | 1 | plus/minus |
| `Знания` | 1 | plus/minus |

Observed starter point pools:

| Pool | Starter Amount | Save Surface |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Primary stat increases | 15 | profile stats form |
| Combat, magic, and resistance skill increases | 10 | `Умения` |
| Peace/world skill increases | 2 | `Умения` |
| New boolean perks | 1 | `Навыки` |

Experience is displayed on the profile as combat experience, fame, valor, and
experience remaining to next level. The observed level-0 starter values were
combat `0`, fame `0`, valor `0`, and `100` to next level.

Design translation:

- level-up grants should feed these explicit pools, not a hidden abstract
  progression tree;
- the main player formula is `base stats + numeric skills + boolean perks +
  equipment/effects`;
- the UI must distinguish base saved values from pending unsaved additions;
- the server must validate every save against the current available point pool;
- spending health/knowledge can change max HP/MP without simply refilling the
  current HP/MP values.

## Level And Experience Table

The 2026-07-27 wiki audit confirms that a new character is level `0` and that
progression is table-driven. `config/gameplay/character_progression.yml`
contains only complete source rows `0..27`. Each row defines:

- the cumulative combat-experience threshold to the next level;
- stat, combat-skill, peace-skill, perk, and NV grants;
- maximum experience awarded by one fight at that current level;
- the source maximum NPC group size for that level.

The launch starter row is `100` XP to level `1`, `15` unspent stat points,
`10` combat points, `2` peace points, and `1` perk point. Reaching level `1`
grants `3` stats, `4` combat points, `3` peace points, `1` perk point, and
`50` NV. Later grants must be read from the catalog rather than derived by a
generic formula.

Rows beyond level `27` are not implemented because the audited wiki rows are
incomplete. A character at the highest complete row can keep experience, but
the server does not invent a threshold or rewards for level `28`.

Configured solo NPC experience is awarded at shared fight completion and
capped by the winner's current table row. Neverlands group experience uses a
more complex distribution that is not completely captured, so a winning side
with multiple player participants currently receives no invented PvE XP split.
The persistent chat timeline may display the exact awarded amount in a concise
fight-completion row after finalization. Character progression remains the XP,
threshold, and grant authority; that feedback row cannot award or recalculate
experience.

## Public Player Info

Neverlands exposes public character info through a direct character-name URL.
The local URL is:

```text
/player/<character-name>
```

Rules:

- lookup is by active character name, not by account email;
- gameplay links that point to a character should use `/player/<character-name>`;
- account-profile routes are not part of player info;
- source-era CGI routes are not part of the local Rails route shape;
- public HTML and JSON expose only public player facts: avatar, name, level,
  location, HP/MP, equipped items, experience, skills, perks, fatigue, attack
  cost, and fight record;
- public HTML uses a paper-doll equipment layout: large avatar centered with
  item slots around the avatar;
- location can include city and sublocation, and an active fight id can turn
  the location display into a public fight-log link;
- formula/detail stat panels are hidden from public player info;
- public payloads must not expose account email, credentials, private session
  state, or non-canonical primary stats.

Observed May 19 public profile behavior:

- idle in the training hall produced location `Форпост [Тренировочный Зал]`
  with fight id `0`;
- during mannequin fights, the same location carried a nonzero fight id;
- the source renderer displayed that nonzero id as `[ в бою ]` linking to the
  fight log between `Форпост` and `Тренировочный Зал`;
- after the fight result was finished, the fight id returned to `0`;
- removing both starter knives removed the public equipment-slot entries and
  changed visible `Пробой брони` from `2` to `0`; restoring the knives restored
  the public armor-pierce value.

## Player Experience

The player levels up, receives points, and assigns them to stats or skills.
Allocation should feel deliberate. The UI should show what changed and why a
locked option is unavailable.

## Stats

Core stat set:

- strength;
- dexterity/agility;
- luck;
- health/endurance;
- knowledge/intelligence;
- action-point relevant derived value.

Stats affect:

- HP/MP;
- action points;
- hit chance;
- dodge/block chance;
- damage;
- carried weight;
- item requirements.

Exact implemented derived rules:

```text
base_max_hp = saved Health × 5
base_max_mp = saved Knowledge × 7
carrying_capacity = effective Strength × 5 + effective Health × 10 + level × 10
combat_action_points = 80 + (10 at level 5) + (10 at level 10) + effective Extra Action Points
```

Saving a stat allocation recalculates the persisted base maxima and clamps a
current value only if it is now above its maximum. It never heals or refills
the character. Inventory, loot, transfer, and Shop capacity checks use the
derived mass result; the historical inventory capacity column remains schema
compatibility state, not gameplay authority.

## Numeric Skills

The implemented numeric registry stores only captured `Умения` ids and tier
rates. It intentionally does not contain effect formulas, prerequisite gates, or
generic skill families.

Combat and weapon skills:

- `0` unarmed combat, rate `10:8:6:4`;
- `1` sword mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `2` axe mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `3` bludgeoning weapon mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `4` knife mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `5` throwing weapon mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `6` halberd/spear mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `7` staff mastery, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `8` exotic weapon mastery, rate `6:4:4:2`;
- `9` two-handed weapon mastery, rate `10:8:6:4`;
- `10` dual-wielding, rate `4:4:2:2`;
- `11` extra action points, rate `2:2:2:2`.

Extra Action Points is the second bounded numeric-skill effect: each effective
point adds one AP to the character's next persisted fight profile. Weapon
mastery still has no local AP-reduction or damage coefficient because the
source pages publish direction but not the exact formula.

Magic and resistance skills:

- `12` fire magic, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `13` water magic, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `14` air magic, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `15` earth magic, rate `8:6:4:2`;
- `16` fire magic resistance, rate `6:4:2:2`;
- `17` water magic resistance, rate `6:4:2:2`;
- `18` air magic resistance, rate `6:4:2:2`;
- `19` earth magic resistance, rate `6:4:2:2`;
- `20` physical damage resistance, rate `6:4:2:2`.

Peace/world skills:

- `22` caution, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `23` stealth, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `24` observation, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `26` wanderer, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `27` linguistics, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `30` self-healing, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `33` fast mana regeneration, rate `2:2:2:2`;
- `34` leadership, rate `6:4:3:2`.

Profession counters such as trading, herbalism, mining, and fishing were visible
in the source page, but not as the current allocatable numeric skill controls.
Their activity rules must be established separately. The
[Trader/Doctor wiki clarification](../reference/economy/observations/2026-09-09_licenses_and_shop_selling.md#profession-prerequisites-wiki-clarification-2026-09-10)
records that Trading begins at zero, improves through Shop sales rather than
Market/direct-player sales, and affects Shop resale rates. It does not state
a positive Trading threshold for buying the first license. The exact growth
chance and increment remain uncaptured; the local Shop reads saved Trading
proficiency for its documented resale tiers but does not award growth.

## Boolean Perks

`Навыки` are a separate yes/no progression surface. They do not share the
0-100 numeric-skill registry or either numeric-skill point pool.

The launch-safe captured subset is deliberately small:

| Source ID | Local Key | Source Label | Launch Behavior |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | `more_strength` | `Больше силы` | Spend one new-perk point; effective Strength gains `floor(level / 2)`. |
| 15 | `careful_fighter` | `Аккуратный боец` | Spend one new-perk point; halve each equipped item's post-fight durability-loss chance. |
| 34 | `merchant` | `Купец` | Spend one new-perk point; satisfy the ability prerequisite for Merchant qualification and trading licenses. |
| 35 | `healer` | `Целительство` | Spend one new-perk point; satisfy the ability prerequisite for doctor licenses. |

The wiki supplies both bounded effects and the existing live capture supplies
their selectable source identities. `more_strength` affects effective Strength,
including downstream mass and combat reads, but does not rewrite saved stat
allocation. `careful_fighter` is consumed only by shared fight finalization and
does not alter an item's stored durability outside a completed-fight roll.

The full live id/name/category catalog is captured in
`doc/design/reference/character/observations/2026-05-11_player_profile_and_development.md`. This includes all profession,
stat, resistance, magic, auxiliary, and warrior rows, so branch names no longer
need to be inferred. Source IDs `7`, `15`, `22`, `34` and `35` are selectable for launch;
prerequisite gates, reset behavior, and mechanical effects for the other
entries are not fully captured or implemented. Nature Child's four-point
drinking recovery ships when owned; the exact Wanderer/outdoor HP bonuses
remain unknown. See the World-related skill/perk gap owner in
`doc/features/character_progression.md` section 6.5 and the current wiki record
`doc/design/reference/world/observations/2026-09-09_wiki_skills_and_cell_actions.md`.

Merchant and Healer ownership alone grant no timed license, profession skill,
medical treatment or quest completion. Boolean perk ownership, numeric
profession proficiency, quest qualification and a timed license are separate
requirements and must not substitute for one another. The
[economy design](economy_trading_shops.md) owns the license prerequisite table;
the [Shop handbook](../../features/shop_economy.md) identifies the implemented
Merchant qualification and the missing Doctor quest flows. Doctor II/III
require Traumatologist quest completion. The published `100` Doctor proficiency
threshold, including applicable equipment, is a quest-entry requirement; it is
not evidence for an additional continuous license-purchase or validity check.
The Doctor page does not state an additional license-purchase quest gate for
tier I, while its separate initial medical quest governs light-injury treatment
and bag-crafting progression.

Perk allocation rules:

- available new-perk points are shown on the dedicated perks page;
- an unowned, captured perk can be previewed with plus/minus controls;
- save validates the current point pool and persists the binary choice;
- an owned perk is displayed as `Yes` and is not removable through the normal
  allocation UI;
- incompatible branches are rejected server-side and hidden or disabled in
  the preview UI;
- the captured exclusion table is retained by source ID, but additional named
  perks are not rendered or selectable until their requirements and effects
  are captured.

## Rules

- Points are earned through level-up and relevant gameplay.
- Level thresholds and grants come only from the finite source-backed catalog.
- Spending points is server-authoritative.
- Stat, numeric-skill, perk, and level-up transitions reload the character
  under a row lock before spending or granting points.
- Primary stat allocation uses an explicit available-point counter and pending
  additions per stat.
- Numeric skills are stored and displayed as 0-100 values.
- Boolean perks are stored and displayed as selected/unselected values.
- Numeric skills and boolean perks use separate registries, pages, and point
  pools.
- Numeric skill allocation can preview client-side, but the final save must be
  validated server-side.
- Numeric skill point pools are separate: combat/magic/resistance and
  peace/world.
- Skill prerequisites are not implemented until captured from Neverlands.
- Skills may use tiered progression, where later ranks cost more effort.
- Boolean perks spend a separate new-perk pool and can remove incompatible
  options from the current selection UI.
- Equipment and effects can modify effective skill, but base skill remains
  visible.
- Respec, if available, should be limited and expensive.

## Interactions

- `features/movement.md`: World consumes effective Wanderer with the bounded
  MVP `30..24` second adjacent-step fallback, unless the destination has an
  exact authored duration. The complete Neverlands timing
  formula and every other movement modifier remain uncaptured.
- `features/combat.md`: Combat consumes effective Extra Action Points one-for-one
  and Careful Fighter at finalization. Weapon mastery, defense, magic, and
  resistance skills still need exact formula capture before changing combat.
- `features/items_inventory_equipment.md`: item requirements use stats/skills.
- `features/social_chat_presence.md`: presents the authoritative combat-XP
  amount supplied by finalization; it does not own XP or level grants.
- `features/professions.md`: profession perks and use-grown counters remain a
  separate source-backed progression area and are not allocated as ordinary
  numeric skills.
- `features/npcs_quests.md`: future quest interactions need source capture
  before granting skill points or unlocking future source-backed training.

## Out Of Scope

- Unlimited free respec.
- Skills that only exist as UI decoration.
- Extrapolated level rows, invented group-XP distribution, or generic classes.
